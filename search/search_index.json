During a POGIL activity, students work in self-managed teams through a learning cycle of exploration, concept invention, and application. The instructor is not a lecturer, but rather an active facilitator who helps all students to be engaged and achieve the learning objectives. Students discover key concepts and construct their own knowledge while collaborating with others. Using team roles and other scaffolding, students develop process skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and written/oral communication. The instructor guides the process, creates opportunities for teams to report out, and offers additional support as needed.</p>"},{"location":"info/about/#the-pogil-project","title":"The POGIL Project","text":"<ul> <li>https://pogil.org/</li> <li>https://pogil.org/what-is-pogil</li> <li>https://pogil.org/faqs</li> </ul>"},{"location":"info/about/#history-of-cs-pogil","title":"History of CS-POGIL","text":"<p>list of past grants and related projects</p>"},{"location":"info/about/#sample-cs-activity","title":"Sample CS Activity","text":"<p>https://www.engage-csedu.org/find-resources/introduction-python</p>"},{"location":"info/about/#acknowledgments","title":"Acknowledgments","text":"<p>Material on this website is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant numbers 1044679, 1626765, and 2216454.

Instead of passively listening to a traditional lecture, POGIL students work together on activities that guide students to discover programming concepts and algorithms for themselves. For example, instead of being told in lecture that a return statement ends the execution of a method, students might be asked what happens if two lines in their program are reversed (so that a line of code appears after the return statement). This emphasis on the process of discovery teaches students to become better problem solvers. POGIL has been used for over 15 years in science classrooms, where studies have shown it to be more effective than traditional lectures, measured both in student mastery of the material and in student retention.This poster provides examples of how traditional programming assignments can be transformed into POGIL lessons that emphasize problem solving and critical thinking skills. A POGIL activity on loops has students working through iterations of Newton\u2019s method by hand before writing the code. Critical thinking questions guide students to manipulate the code to experiment with infinite loops, initialization statements and conditionals. Two other activities on recursion and writing pseudocode are detailed on the poster. Information on facilitating a POGIL activity and writing your own POGIL activities can be found online at http://pogil.org/resources.

One evidence-based approach to address these challenges is Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL), in which student teams work on classroom activities specifically designed to help them construct understanding and develop key skills. While POGIL has been widely used and studied in Chemistry and other STEM fields, much less is known about how it is used in Computer Science. In this study, we examined how faculty adopt POGIL for the first time in introductory CS classrooms. Using qualitative in-depth interviews, we investigated why faculty chose to adopt POGIL and their concerns about using it.

Here are presented two activities aimed at supporting the early development of engineering students\u2019 attitudes and abilities regarding programming in a first-year engineering course. Both activities offer students insights into the way programs are constructed, which have been identified as a source of confusion that may negatively affect acceptance. In the first activity, a structured, language-independent way to approach programming problems through guided questions was introduced, which has previously been used successfully in introductory computer science courses. The team hypothesized that guiding students through a structured reflection on how they construct programs for their class assignments might help reveal an understandable structure to them. Results showed that students in the intervention group scored nearly a full letter grade higher on the unit\u2019s final programming assessment than those in the control condition. The second activity aimed to help students recognize how their experience with MATLAB might help them interpret code in other programming languages. In the intervention group, students were asked to review and provide comments for code written in a variety of programming languages. A qualitative analysis of their reflections examined what skills students reported they used and, specifically, how prior MATLAB experience may have aided their ability to read and comment on the unfamiliar code. Overall, the ability to understand and recognize syntactic constructs was an essential skill in making sense of code written in unfamiliar programming languages. Syntactic constructs, lexical elements, and patterns were all recognized as essential landmarks used by students interpreting code they did not write, especially in new languages. Developing an understanding of the static structure and dynamic flow required of programs was also an essential skill which helped the students. Together, the results from the first activity and the insights gained from the second activity suggest that guided questions to build skills in reading code may help mitigate confusion about program construction, thereby better preparing engineering students for computing-intensive careers.</p>","tags":["article"]},{"location":"research/2022/bettin-2022-engineering/#metadata","title":"Metadata","text":"<p> Download .bib file</p> Field Value author Bettin, Briana and Jarvie-Eggart, Michelle and Steelman, Kelly S. and Wallace, Charles title Preparing First-Year Engineering Students to Think About Code: A Guided Inquiry Approach year 2022 issue_date Aug. 2022 publisher IEEE Press volume 65 number 3 issn 0018-9359 url https://doi.org/\u2026 doi 10.1109/TE.2021.3140051 journal IEEE Transactions on Education month aug pages 309\u2013319 numpages 11","tags":["article"]},{"location":"research/2022/bunde-2022-helen-hu/","title":"Conversation with a Prominent Propagator: Helen Hu","text":"<p>Authors: David P.

However, most research about POGIL in computer science has focused on perceptions and experiences, not learning outcomes. In this study, we examined the influence of POGIL on student learning in CS1. We collected data from all sections of CS1 at the same institution. Four of the faculty implemented POGIL, and three taught with other active methods. The learning data included pre and post assessments, midterm and final exams, and a retention test at the beginning of the next course. Students also completed three surveys about their prior programming experience, sense of belonging, and perceptions of teamwork. We used multiple regression to analyze the relationship between the survey data and learning outcomes. Our results show that students in the POGIL sections outperformed students in the other sections.

By the end of the summer, 29 different authors drafted 73 activities in nine different areas of CS. 62 activities were revised until approved by the program as high-quality POGIL activities ready for classroom testing, doubling the number of peer-reviewed POGIL activities in CS. This model of supporting instructors as they write POGIL activities has been so successful that the POGIL Project is considering adopting it for the future.

However, instructors who seek to adopt more effective pedagogies often overestimate their use of such practices and/or omit key elements. Thus, our research seeks to enhance understanding of classroom practice by combining data from student surveys, instructor surveys, and classroom observations (both live and video recorded). This paper describes a new classroom observation protocol intended to monitor the focus (e.g., solo, pair, team, or whole class) and action (e.g., discuss, speak/present, watch/listen, or distracted) of both students and teachers (instructors). The paper summarizes relevant background on evidence-based learning, student engagement, and classroom observation protocols, describes the development and structure of FASTOP, presents results from different pedagogies (e.g., lecture, laboratory, POGIL), and describes lessons learned and future directions.

This paper presents a Bayesian analysis of the student grades using a hierarchical ordinal logistic regression model. The data included the number of A, B, C, D, F, and W grades, disaggregated by gender and race, for all students enrolled in the course. In addition to each POGIL term, faculty submitted grades for one or two previous terms when they taught the same course without POGIL. Most faculty observed an improvement in student pass rates in the second and third term after they began teaching with POGIL. We present detailed visualizations of grade distributions from 25 faculty, along with the results of the statistical analysis. Our model suggests that CS1 faculty adopting POGIL can expect to see a modest increase of A grades and a modest decrease of DFW grades. However, the grades of Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous students decreased slightly, especially in the first term faculty taught with POGIL. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of gender and racial analysis in evaluating pedagogical approaches.</p>","tags":["ITiCSE"]},{"location":"research/2023/mayfield-2023-grades/#metadata","title":"Metadata","text":"<p> Download .bib file</p> Field Value author Mayfield, Chris and Raleigh, Sean and Hu, Helen H. and Kussmaul, Clif title Analysis of Student Grades Before and After Adopting POGIL year 2023 isbn 9798400701382 publisher Association for Computing Machinery address New York, NY, USA url https://doi.org/\u2026 doi 10.1145/3587102.3588782 booktitle Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education pages 547\u2013553 numpages 7 keywords CS1, grade distribution, logistic regression, ordinal data location Turku, Finland series ITiCSE \u201823","tags":["ITiCSE"]},{"location":"research/2024/inventado-2024-urm/","title":"Exploring the Effects of a Collaborative Guided Inquiry Learning Approach on Performance and Retention of Underrepresented Minority Students across Multiple Sections in an Introductory Programming Course","text":"<p>Authors: Paul Salvador Inventado, Joshua Caleb Dy</p> <p>Source: Proceedings of the 55<sup>th</sup> ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education</p> <p>URL: https://doi.org/10.1145/3626252.3630853</p>","tags":["SIGCSE"]},{"location":"research/2024/inventado-2024-urm/#abstract","title":"Abstract","text":"<p>This preliminary study investigates the impact of a collaborative guided inquiry learning (CGIL) approach on the retention and performance of underrepresented racial minority (URM) students in an Object-Oriented programming course at a Hispanic-serving institution.

These outcomes are closely linked to higher levels of student engagement. To better understand the relationship between student engagement and pedagogical approach, our research documents what actually happens in CS1 classes that implement active learning. This paper presents a case study of two instructors, at different undergraduate institutions, teaching with Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) and Interactive Lectures. Using structured classroom observations and student surveys, we measure the engagement of the same students in different class periods taught by the same instructor. Our study investigates the differences and similarities in self-reported and observed student behaviors, as well as observed instructor behaviors. We examine how instructor behavior impacts student behavior. The results show significant differences in observed instructor and student behaviors based on the pedagogical approach. In class periods where instructors spoke more, students were more inclined to watch or listen rather than actively work or discuss, coupled with higher levels of student distraction. Our results provide insight into how specific teaching practices can lead to more engaging classrooms and better student outcomes.</p>","tags":["SIGCSE"]},{"location":"research/2025/campbell-2025-engage/#metadata","title":"Metadata","text":"<p> Download .bib file</p> Field Value author Campbell, Patricia B. and Kussmaul, Clif and Mayfield, Chris and Hu, Helen H. and Campbell-Mortman, Seth title Variation in Engagement Behaviors among Student-Centered Pedagogies year 2025 isbn 9798400705311 publisher Association for Computing Machinery address New York, NY, USA url https://doi.org/\u2026 doi 10.1145/3641554.3701894 booktitle Proceedings of the 56<sup>th</sup> ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education pages 185\u2013191 numpages 7 keywords active learning, classroom observation, collaborative learning, comparative study location Pittsburgh, PA, USA series SIGCSE \u201825","tags":["SIGCSE"]}]}
