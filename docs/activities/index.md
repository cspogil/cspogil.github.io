# Activities

The following activities are available for classroom use.
If you have written or know of other activities, please [let us know](../info/contrib.md)!

Most of the abbreviations correspond to _Knowledge Areas_ from [Computer Science Curricula 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/3664191).
We added separate categories for the introductory courses (CS0, CS1, and CS2) for convenience.

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
