  abstract   = {In this article, we interviewed Helen Hu, Professor and Chair of Computer Science at Westminster College. Helen is best known for her work promoting and developing Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) for Computer Science with Clif Kussmaul, Chris Mayfield, Tammy Pirmann, and others [4, 6–9]. POGIL is an instructional strategy in which students work in small, self-managed teams with specific roles. POGIL activities are designed to guide students through discovering key concepts, while developing skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and working in teams. Rather than lecturing, instructors act as guides through the process [5]. More about Helen’s work on POGIL in CS can be found at [5].},
