  abstract = {In this paper, we describe Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL), an evidence-based instructional strategy that incorporates multiple practices that are particularly useful for students from underrepresented populations. In a POGIL classroom, students work in teams on activities that are specifically designed to guide them to discover and understand core concepts (the guided inquiry). At the same time, teams develop process skills such as communication, teamwork, critical thinking, and problem solving (the process oriented). The teacher is an active facilitator who observes and coaches teams, helps to resolve problems, and leads classroom discussion.

First, we describe the underlying motivation, key elements, and related research. Second, we briefly describe the elements of a typical POGIL activity to show how student teams, activity design, and active facilitation by a teacher interact to create a powerful learning experience. As an example, we use a POGIL activity on project scheduling that helps students to understand key concepts in the context of baking cookies. Finally, we briefly describe other POGIL activities in the EngageCSEdu collection and summarize available resources to help teachers learn about and implement POGIL in their classrooms.}
