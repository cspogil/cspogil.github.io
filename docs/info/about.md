# About POGIL / CS-POGIL

POGIL is an evidence-based instructional strategy with a long history in STEM education.
During a POGIL activity, students work in self-managed teams through a learning cycle of exploration, concept invention, and application.
The instructor is not a lecturer, but rather an active facilitator who helps all students to be engaged and achieve the learning objectives.
Students discover key concepts and construct their own knowledge while collaborating with others.
Using team roles and other scaffolding, students develop process skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and written/oral communication.
The instructor guides the process, creates opportunities for teams to report out, and offers additional support as needed.
