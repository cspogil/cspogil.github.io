  abstract  = {This chapter describes a five stage faculty development (FD) program to support faculty who teach introductory computer science (IntroCS) as they adopt Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL), a social constructivist approach that has been shown to improve student motivation and learning outcomes. The FD program and its assessment includes elements matched to five stages of faculty interest and adoption. This expanded scope provides some clear benefits, but also some notable challenges. The chapter describes the practices and insights at each stage, summarizes insights that should be useful to other FD efforts, and considers some challenges and future directions.}
